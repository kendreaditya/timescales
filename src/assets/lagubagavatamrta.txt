 - The four Sanas and Narada appear during Brahméa’s first day, the Brahma-kalpa. They remain through all the kalpas. (3.7)
 - Varaha Dev:
  - Sri Varaha (3) is described in the First Canto (1.3.7): “The supreme enjoyer of all sacrifices accepted the incarnation of a boar [the second incarnation], and for the welfare of the earth He lifted the earth from the nether regions of the universe.” (3.8)
  - And in the Second Canto [2.7.1]: “When the unlimitedly powerful Lord assumed the form of a boar as a pastime, just to lift the planet earth, which was drowned in the great ocean of the universe called the Garbhodaka, the first demon [Hiranyaksa] appeared, and the Lord pierced him with His tusk.” (3.9)
  - He appeared twice in this day of Brahma. He first appeared during the reign of Svayambhuva, the first Manu. He came out from the nostril ofLord Brahm and raised the earth planet from the lower regions of the universe. That supreme among tusked animals appeared again during the reign of Caksusa Manu. At that time, while lifting up the earth He came out from the universal waters to kill Hiranyaksa. Sri Varaha has four legs, but sometimes He is understood to have a form as half-man, half-boar. (3.10)
    * First appearence Svayambhuva Manu raised the earth planet from the lower regions of the universe
    * Second apperance Caksusa Manu came out from the universal waters lifiting Earth
 - We hear from scripture how Daksa, son of the Pracetas, repopulated the universe during the sixth manvantara. From this account it is reasonable to conclude that Hiranyaksa was born during that period. (3.13)
  * Dakasa repopulated the universe during the sixth manvantara
 - mid-Manvantara annihilation
  - Some Puranas mention an annihilation of the universe that occurs in the middle of a manvantara because of Manu’s being cursed by a sage (3.18)
  - This exceptional occurrence happened during the reign of Caksugsa Manu. At other times Lord Padmanabha has personally enacted the pastime of universal annihilation. (3.19)
  * mid-Manvantara annihilation happened during the reign of Caksugsa Manu
 - In the Visnu-dharmottara Purana [1.75.2-3] Markandeya states that the universe is certainly annihilated at the end of each manvantara: (3.20)
  * The universe is certainly annihilated at the end of each manvantara
  - Commentary: Although the lower part of the universe also floods at the end of every manvantara, at those times the earth does not sink in the universal flood but floats unseen on the surface of the turbulent water.
 - Matsya
    * At the end of the first manvantara, Matsya comes on a boat to save Vaivasvata Manu. (3.23-30) from a universal flood
    - Sri Matsya (4) is described in the First Canto [1.3.15]: “When there was a complete inundation after the period of the Caksusa Manu and the whole world was submerged in water, the Lord accepted the form of a fish and protected Vaivasvata Manu, keeping him on a boat that was actually the earth. " (3.31)
     * Flood after Caksusa Manu and Lord Matsya appeared to save Vaivasvata Manu
    - And in the Second Canto [2.7.12]: “At the end of the millennium, Satyavrata, the future Vaivasvata Manu, saw the Lord in His fish incarnation as the shelter of the earth and all kinds of living entities. Because of my fear of the vast water at the end of the millennium, the teachings of the Vedas come out of my mouth. The Lord enjoyed those vast water and protected the Vedas. " (3.32)
    - Like Lord Varaha, Lord Matsya has appeared twice in this day of Brahma. He first appeared at the beginning of Svayambhuva’s reign, when He killed a demon and recovered the Vedas. His second appearance occurred at the end of the Caksusa manvantara, when He showed mercy to Satyavrata. (3.33)
     * Flood at beginning of Svayambhuva’s reign and Lord Matsya recovered the Vedas
     * Second appearance at the end of the Caksusa manvantara, when He showed mercy to Satyavrata
 - Yajna: Sri Jajna appeared during the reign of Svayambhuva Manu. (3.37-38) and was called Hari.
 - Lord Nrsirhha appeared in the sixth manvantara, before the churning of the Milk Ocean. Thus He appeared prior to Karma and the other incarnations who appeared in the sixth manvantara. (3.65)
  * Lord Nrsirhha appeared in the sixth manvantara
  * Churning of milk ocean is in sixth manvantara (3.70)
 - Lord Vamana has appeared three times in this day of Brahma. The first time He visited the sacrifice of Baskali, king of the demons. During the current Vaivasvata manvantara, Lord Vamana first went to the sacrifice of Dhundhu, and then later, in the seventh yuga-cycle of this manvantara, He took birth as the son of Kasyapa from the womb of Aditi. Lord Trivikrama has thus appeared three times for the purpose of accepting charity. (3.74)
  * First time Vamana dev appeared -- Baskali, king of the demons in the first  first manvantara, that of Svayambhuva (3.74)
  * Second time Vamana dev appeared -- Vaivasvata manvantara and went to Lord Vamana first went to the sacrifice of Dhundhu
  * Third time Vamana dev appeared -- Seventh yuga-cycle of this manvantara, He took birth as the son of Kasyapa from the womb of Aditi
 - Parasurama: this golden-complexioned incarnation appeared from Renuka and Jamadagni. Some say He descended during the seventeenth yuga cycle, but others say He descended during the twenty-second. (3.76)
 - In the Treté-yuga of the twenty-fourth yuga cycle, Lord Ramacandra appeared through Daégaratha from the womb of Kausalya, His complexion like lustrous new blades of darva grass. He was joined by Bharata and devatvam —the role of a king; dpannah—having assumed; sura—of the the two sons of Sumitra. (3.78)
  * Lord Ramacandra appeared in the Treta-yuga of the twenty-fourth yuga cycle of 7th manvantara
 - In the fifth manvantara, ruled by Raivata, Vaikuntha appeared: “From the combination of Subhra and his wife Vikuntha there appeared the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vaikuntha, along with the best of demigods, the Vaikunthas, His personal plenary expansions.” |Bhagavatam 8.5.4] (4.11)
  * Vaikuntha appeared in the fifth manvantara, ruled by Raivata

Questoins:
 - Who is Lord Padmanabha? And why does he enact annihilations? (3.18)
 - When does the milk ocean churning happen? (3.65)
 - Aliough at the end of each Dvapara-yuga a different sage is given the role of Vyasa, editor of the Vedas, Krsna Dvaipayana Vyasa is unique among all of them since He is a svmsa expasion of the Personality of Godhead. (3.82-84)
  - There are different Vyasa?
 - Suta spoke on the topic of Lord Buddha before he had actually appeared. Since then he has taken birth in the village of Dharmaranya. (3.92)
  - But Gotham Buddha didn't appear in the village of Dharmaranya (current day Modhera?)?
